CKit and thread
===============

CKit internal uses `pthread' to protected shared data structure to
prevent multi-thread broke.

If CKit cannot found pthread on your system, it will continue work,
but is not MF safe, that is, you should not adopt it in a multi-pthread
application.

Only pthread is support now(maybe future), beacuse it is POSIX standard
and broad adopt in industry. there also has a pthread for win32 too.
