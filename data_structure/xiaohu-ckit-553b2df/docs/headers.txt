headers
=======

DON'T includes so many headers into every source file.

CKit configure script generate ckit-config.h file, which already
includes `standard' headers. include this file rather than system
headers is strong recommendatory. but before include this file,
you should check whether your source's header include it already.

is it so complex?
maybe! in a word, you should keep included headers as few as possible.

CKit has below rules:
ckit-type.h includes ckit-config.h and ckit-macro.h

so only include ckit-type.h into your source's header is right
at most case.
