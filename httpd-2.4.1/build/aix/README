The script buildaix.ksh will attempt to build a AIX installp fileset
out of a source tree for httpd.

REQUIREMENTS:
fileset bos.adt.insttools

RECOMMENDED:
Toolbox filesets zlib and zlib-devel
Toolbox fileset coreutils

To build a package, make sure you are in the root of the source tree,
and run:

build/aix/buildaix.ksh

## coming - argument to leave the DESTDIR results for manual
## modifications to the template (to create seperate filesets)

An AIX fileset named <PKG>.<NAME>.<version>.<architecture>.I will be
created in the build/aix directory. Also included is the .template file.

KNOWN issues:
on AIX libtool is known to have issues with the install command.
many of these issues can be resolved by inserting the GNU install command
earlier in the PATH variable. Testing has shown that this may still
have issues when installing to DESTDIR. To compensate for this
the buildaix.ksh also does a "regular" make install before executing
the make DESTDIR=$TEMPDIR install command

TODO
Add Apache LICENSE to fileset and require acceptance
Add test for bos.adt.insttools at start of build script
